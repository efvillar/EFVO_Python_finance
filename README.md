# EFVO_Python_finance
Some examples of python for finance.  Examples weres created by Diego Fernandez and they are explained in their Udemy's courses.
I just pretend to explain how it works to a beginner level as a reference to create new algorithms.
I also changed the format of scripts from python files to notebook files, and added some comments
